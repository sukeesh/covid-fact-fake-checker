Source of data: [WHO Myth Busters](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters)

## How does it work?

I have stored all the mythbusters listed on WHO website in (this file)[https://github.com/sukeesh/covid-fact-fake-checker/blob/master/facts.py] and later whenever there is a query, this query is matched with every factual sentence present with us and the sentence which has the maximum cosine similarity is responded.
